# TimeOfDay
An app with the sole purpose of providing a complication that shows the time on the bezel of the Series 4 Apple Watch

# Purpose
Mostly for playing around with WatchOS and complications.

# Code
There is a fair amount of commented-out code.  As this is mostly for experimentation in WatchOS, there are also several print statements so I can see what is going on in the console.

# Helping out 
If you want to help out at all, or have comments on the code, please let me know!  I'm here to learn.  Submit a pull request for corrections or improvements.  Create an issue if you just have a comment on something.
